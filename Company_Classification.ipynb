Beauty Call   Rated 5 out of 5 with 7 ratings on Google My Business         Beauty Call      Gemma  Sidcup, Kent      I was married on 12th May and Sam from Beauty Call did my hair and make up and I couldn’t have asked for any one better than to carry out one of the most important parts of a brides day. She is great at what she does and was great from the initial trial all the way until the end, she even helped me in my dress!! Thank you! xx    5 / 5         Beauty Call      Gee  South East London      I got married last week and Sam from Beauty Call did an amazing job on the hair and makeup for me, my bridesmaids and my mum! We all felt like a million dollars all day and the hairdos held up really well after several hours of energetic dancing :).\\xa0 I live abroad so wasn’t able to have a trial before the wedding but on the day my artist immediately understood what I was looking for and was also a lovely, friendly and calming presence while we were getting ready. Would definitely recommend!    5 / 5         Beauty Call      Jennie  Harlow      I got married in October 2017 and Becky and Vanessa from Beauty Call provided me and my bridesmaids with hair and make-up. To say I was impressed is an understatement. The girls were incredible. They made us all feel so comfortable and were so accommodating. I am not a make-up person but Becky made me feel like a total princess and my make-up was perfect. My bridesmaids looked fabulous. Thank you so much    5 / 5         Beauty Call      Gayle  Manchester      I booked Beauty Call for my wedding, for myself, 4 bridesmaids and both mothers. The service was faultless, from the initial contact right through to the final result! Thank you.    5 / 5         Beauty Call      Julia  London      Could not recommended Annabel from Beauty Call more highly! She did my makeup and hair for my wedding yesterday (and also provided crucial help with my dress!). The makeup looked wonderful, just the right balance between glam and natural beauty. It lasted all night with just a couple lipstick touch ups, despite heat and many happy tears. The romantic updo she created looked brilliant as well, and also held up nicely despite wind throughout the day. She was also timely (so I was ready in good time), and she was a joy to chat to all morning. Her cheerfulnees and calm really put me at ease. Thank you!    5 / 5         Beauty Call      Cassandra  Horsham, Sussex      The whole process was very easy to use, with prices clearly set out and explained. Samantha from Beauty Call was the artist assigned to me and I couldn’t be happier with the work she done not just on me but my bridesmaids too, she listened to everything I wanted and created the look I was after. I’m personally not into hair and make up but Samantha made the whole experience easy, enjoyable and fun for us all on both the trail and wedding day. My dad even commented that ‘I didn’t scrub up too bad!’, and that was mainly down to the work that Samantha did. She was even able to help with tying up the dress when everyone got confused on how to do it all up. Nothing was too much trouble and I would highly recommend her. Thank you xxx.    5 / 5         Beauty Call      Jade  Cardiff, Wales      Marie from Beauty Call did my hair and make up for my wedding in June. She also did hair and make up for my bridesmaids and mothers of the bride&groom. She was absolutely fantastic throughout the whole process. I needed 2 trials as after my first I wasn’t sure the hairstyles we had tried were right for my hair type, and she was happy to listen to my worries, arrange a second trial and completely change tack on what I wanted! On the day she and her assistant worked so hard and really helped calm my nerves! Make up was exactly what I wanted and despite a windy summers day my hairstyle lasted all day. All the girls looked great, and they accommodated superbly what each bridesmaid requested. Absolutely fantastic, would definitely recommend!    5 / 5                 Hair & Makeup Artists all over the UK  Wondering if we have a hair & makeup artist near you?
